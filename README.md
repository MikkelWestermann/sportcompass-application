It's a simple responsive product page for the fictional company "RoboShop". You can browse through a (literally) endless amount of robots and add the ones you desire to your cart and if you change your mind, then you can always remove them. The images are supplied by Robohash (https://robohash.org/) (I've noticed that robohash is quite slow at times, so your mileage may vary), the text is supplied by the Bacon Ipsum API (https://baconipsum.com/json-api/) and manufacturer and model number is generated/assigned in the app.

Tech used:
  - React
  - reactstrap/Bootstrap
